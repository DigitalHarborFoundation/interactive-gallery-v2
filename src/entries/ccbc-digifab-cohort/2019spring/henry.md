My project is a pinball machine mechanism. 

I created this mechanism using a guide I found on youtube. However, the one on the guide was smaller then I wanted and was made using cardboard.   Naturally Zion and I had a urge to improve it. We divided up the components into 5 pieces then each created two in fusion360 then collaborated on the fifth piece piece. Communication was key in making sure that everything fit with either.

The project seemed big at first and was hard to comprehend. Dividing everything into smaller tasks helped us overcome this

I feel as though my Teamwork and communication skills greatly improved in making this project.
