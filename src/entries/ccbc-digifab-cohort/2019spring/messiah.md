My project is a mask,

 I made this using hardwork and brain cells. I first designed this in Inkscape but switched to Tinkercad because I wanted to make certain shapes that could not be achieved by Inkscapes tools s 

 Tinkercad did not have the shapes needed to create my mask so I had to make my own shapes.

 I learned really how to create new objects to make what I need to make

You are going to face hardships down the road because of the people at tinkercad and how they don't want you to win
