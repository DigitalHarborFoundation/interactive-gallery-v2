My project is a toy robot that connects with joints.

I first made the arms, legs, body, and head separately. Then i made holes in them and connector pieces to attach them to the body. 

I learned how to make precise objects in tinkercad.

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to always make sure you have exact measurements and everything fits together.
