My project is a boat assembled from connector pieces and wood boards

I made it first by taking wood pieces and imagining how they could go together to form a design, I settled on a boat. I then designed connector pieces in Tinkercad and fabricated them, along with some additional wood pieces I needed.

One challenge I faced is that my wood pieces were not symmetrical, meaning each end of the boat had to be designed differently and the whole thing had to go together in a very specific way. I also had to make it float.

One new skill I learned is how to make pieces that connected and stayed together without glue or tape

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to ensure that your wood pieces are symmetrical, and that all your pieces are light enough to float and be sturdy enough to stay in the holes in the wood.
