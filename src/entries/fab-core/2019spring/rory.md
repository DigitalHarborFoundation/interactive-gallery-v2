My project is various things made using 2 dimensional design for fun

i used inkscape and fusion360 to make the designs, then i cut them out with the vinyl cutter and the laser cutter.

One challenge I faced was that the fusion360 files kept getting interpreted incorrectly by the laser cutter software

One thing I'd like to tell people about this is it is hard to get things sized correctly

One new skill I learned is how to use fusion360

One thing I'd tell someone else who was making this project is to convert your units to the default of both software beforehand if they are different
