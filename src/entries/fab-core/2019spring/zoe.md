I made a three wheeled car out of 3D printed and laser cut parts.

First I sketched out my design. I then did the Front part of the car using a 3D printing website. Then I made the body of the car from wood that had been laser cut. I finally made the back half using the same 3D printing website. 

One challenge I faced was that when I made the first two pieces of the car, I realized that both pieces didn't work.

I learned how to use "Inkscape".

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to make a smaller version first to make sure that everything works.
