I diagramed it, and drew it out. I then started the process of creating my design in Tinkercad, a 3D printing software.

I didn't face many problems.

I would like to tell people that this project took a long time to work on, and I am really proud of it.

I would tell someone else who is making the project to be precise, and not cut corners.
