my project is a laser cut and 3D printed flower

i made it by first designing the 3D printed parts and then the laser cut parts and finally putting it together

One challenge I faced was that i ended up restarting my whole project so i'd say that was a problem

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is make sure you are happy with your project before fabricating it
