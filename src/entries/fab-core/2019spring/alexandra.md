My project is part of a long series of astroid curves I made, a special type of mathematical form that doesn't really curve, but looks like it does.

To make this project, I used Inkscape. First I would use the polygon generator to make a large shape, usually 30-40 sides. After that I would connect each corner with one a set number of spaces away, and continue around the circle. Finally, I would replace the polygon with a circle for a smoother finish.

It was difficult to vary patterns, and keep the number of points skipped regular.

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is that it's not that hard, you probably just need practice if it doesn't turn out.
