My project shows 3D animated dragons with background music.

I composed music using Online sequencer as a guideline for what I wanted the dragons to do. Then, I downloaded models of dragons and loaded them in blender (a 3D animation program). Then, I posed them in certain points along a timeline to animate them.

3D animation is difficult and tedious, making it take a long time. I originally wanted to make a short film, but making a complete animation became too difficult. 

I learned to animate 3D models. I also learned to manage multiple aspects of something at once to make a more well-rounded final project.

I would make sure to manage your time very well and stay as organized as possible.
