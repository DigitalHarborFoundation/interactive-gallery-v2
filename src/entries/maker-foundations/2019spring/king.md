my project is a maze type game / collect type game, also a website

i made it by using html for the website and scratch for the game and piskel for the people.

The challenges i faced were programming the game 

One thing I'd like to tell people is that its a really hard game so good luck.

I learned how to program in scratch and in website

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is good luck trying to program
