My project is a museum that uses Makey Makey and Scratch

I brainstormed and sketched my idea. Then I programmed my project and created the actual museum.

I was having a bit of a brain block at one point. 

I want them to know that a lot of heart and soul went into this project.

I was more in touch with my creative side.

I would tell them to make it their own, and use their imagination.
