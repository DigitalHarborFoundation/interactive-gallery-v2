I made this project in pixel art

One challenge I faced was drawing with the wrong color on accident

One thing I'd like to tell people is that it's a coin

One new thing I learned is how to maneuver with pixel art

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to look at tutorials before you attempt to do this because it's complicated
