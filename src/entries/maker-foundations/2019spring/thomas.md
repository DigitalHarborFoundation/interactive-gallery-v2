My project is a 3D printed wight walker from G.O.T 

I made this with tinkercad and piskel

One challenge I faced was that the wight walker design keep deleting. 

I got better with Tinkercad through this project  

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is that they should also use piskel and tinkercad for their project.
