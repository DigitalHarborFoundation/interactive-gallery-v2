its a series of games that help people like me with a short attention span

i hooked everything up to makey makey piano and made everything conduct electricity

One challenge I faced was that the foil tree would not make any noise nomatter what i did

One thing I'd like to tell people is that i hope you enjoy the challenge

Some new skills I learned are that i can do more in a whole other field that i would have never gotten to explore without dhf

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to stop copying my work
