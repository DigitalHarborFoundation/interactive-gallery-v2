My project is a scratch  game that I use Makey Makey with and linked to glith that have the controles 3d printed

I maded the scratch game and I made the website

The scratch game was  not working.

That it is totally (not) a game about getting free money.

How to how to 3d print a cube.

You need only use scratch nothing else.
