My project is a scratch game that I use Makey Makey with and linked to glith that have the controles 3d printed

I maded the scratch game and I made the website

One challenge I faced was that the scratch game was not working.

One thing I'd like to tell people about my project is that it is totally (not) a game about getting free money.

One new skill I learned was how to 3d print a cube.

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is that you need only use scratch nothing else.
