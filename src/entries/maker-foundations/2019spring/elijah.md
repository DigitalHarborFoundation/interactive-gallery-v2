My project looks like a Nintendo controller. It helps you play games like Super Smash Flash. 

I used Tinkercad to design the game controller. I used one square and two cylinders. Then, I hooked it up to the Makey Makey.

I'd tell people that the project was awesome and it was fun making it. 

I learned to get creative with the supplies I had. You can always ask others for help if you need it, you don't have to be alone.
