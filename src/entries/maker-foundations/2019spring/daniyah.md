first,I went on the website "Thimble" to make a personal website .

I had to persevere trying to write as much as possible

One thing I'd like to tell people is that my project was self made. It took a lot of editing and perseverance .

I learned how to persevere even when I didn't want to. I also learned how to use integrity because I honestly wanted to give up .

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to always use integrity even when you don't want to ! and always persevere .
