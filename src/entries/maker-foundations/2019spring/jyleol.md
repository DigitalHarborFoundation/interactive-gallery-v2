My project is a piano

I make the sprite in pixilart and use scratch for the sound 

One challenge I faced was thinking of a project and keeping it

<!-- One thing I'd tell someone else about this project is i didnt try -->

One new skill I learned was how to resize sprites without having to remake them

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is to have fun
