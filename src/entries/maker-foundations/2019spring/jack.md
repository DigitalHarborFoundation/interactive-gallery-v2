My project is a 3d printed model of Fallingwater, and a website for my design

I made my project by using Fusion 360 to make my building from other pictures of Fallingwater. Then, I printed the design. I also designed a website for my project to sell it to people.

The problem I faced was making the building as close to real life as I could.

I would tell people what the building was.

I learned more skills on Fusion 360.

I would tell people who want to make my project is to take their time.
