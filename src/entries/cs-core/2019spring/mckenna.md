I made a website about google maps.

I opened thimble and made a website using html. It is not finished yet so you can't see it but I was planning to add a rotating sphere with a picture of the earth on it from p5.

One challenge I faced was that making tabs was very hard, I had to do a lot of research, there was a lot of trial and error.

One thing I'd like to tell people about my project is how I made the earth rotate in the background.

I learned about tabs in html and how to make an object rotate in p5.

One thing I would suggest to others is the video that I used to make the tabs.
