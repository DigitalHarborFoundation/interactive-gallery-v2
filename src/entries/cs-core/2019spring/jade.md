My project is a platformer game

To make this, I edited the sprites and used javascript to code it

One challenge I faced is that I deleted my game by mistake

Some new skills I learned are how to use classes and arrays

One thing I'd tell someone else who wanted to make this project is don't be afraid to ask for help
