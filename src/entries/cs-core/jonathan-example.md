My project is the Pi Portal Pilot.

I made this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React). First, I created a prototype of the layout using a tool called Figma. After creating the prototype, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the site.

One challenge I faced was being sure to optimize the site so that it could run on less reliable network connections on a Raspberry Pi. Another problem I faced was figuring out how to make the sidebar menu remember the current position (which toggle is open).

If you were going to make this project I'd definitely recommend prototyping the layout first using something like Figma and receive feedback from your peers before moving into the code!
