My project is a recreation of John Conway's Game of Life.

First I had to create an array of cells, and assign them states.  Then I had to code the processing for how to update them.

I had a hard time making each cell an object of a class.The simulation generates a lot of interesting patterns.

This project has helped me practice my Javascript knowledge. 

One thing I'd tell someone else looking to make this is to make sure to account for cells on the edges that have less than 8 neighbors.
